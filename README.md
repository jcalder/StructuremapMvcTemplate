# StructuremapMvcTemplate
A template for how to use StructureMap in ASP.net MVC with full support for NestedContainers and per request scoping.
## Installation
At this point if you want to use this just copy the files in the BlankMvc/StructureMap/ directory. If there is any interest outside of uShip I'll throw together a nuget.
